# phase-3-codechallenge

# Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

The Code written in this first challenge includes a python function that has the hour( which ranges from 1 - 12), a minute( which ranges from 0 - 59 ) and a period ( in "am" or "pm" ) and converts 12 hour time into 24 hour time that displays 

# Two numbers are positive

The code in this challenge includes writing a function, which takes three integers a, b, and c as arguments, and returns True if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False - otherwise.

# Consonant value

The code written in this challenge includes writting a function that is given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, returning the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".We shall assign the following values: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26.

For example, for the word "zodiacs", let's cross out the vowels. We get: "z d cs"

-- The consonant substrings are: "z", "d" and "cs" and the values are z = 26, d = 4 and cs = 3 + 19 = 22. The highest is 26.
Meaning it will output 26.
